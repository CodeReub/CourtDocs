# CourtDocs
A Python program to convert documents from certain court reporting systems to text files.

This project began in 2016 as a limited series of individual programs each manipulating a particular style of report.
Changes throughout 2017 included new report styles. 
In early 2018, the various reports were consolidated into a single program with a GUI radio button selector as the primary interface.

Continuing development is needed to improve the graphical user interface, clean up sloppy code, improve error testing throughout and add comments where needed.

As a note, this was my first project as I studied Python through the SoloLearn course and by referring to documentation for Python, openpyxl, tkinter and other modules.
